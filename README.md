Google Colab Integration: Easy-to-use Jupyter notebooks hosted on Google Colab for seamless collaboration and execution.

# Hand_written_digit_prediction
# Overview
Handwritten Digit Prediction is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately recognize and classify digits (0-9) written by hand. This project uses a neural network to achieve high accuracy in digit recognition.

# Dataset
The model is trained and tested on the MNIST dataset, which is a large database of handwritten digits commonly used for training various image processing systems. The dataset contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each being a 28x28 grayscale image.

# Movie_recommendation
# Overview
This project is a Movie Recommendation System designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences and past interactions. The system leverages collaborative filtering techniques and content-based filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations.

# Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on the userâ€™s past behavior and preferences of similar users.

Content-Based Filtering: Suggests movies based on the features of the movies the user has liked in the past.

Hybrid Approach: Combines collaborative and content-based filtering to improve recommendation accuracy.

Interactive Interface: Created using Google Colab for ease of use and interactive experimentation.

Real-time Recommendations: Generates recommendations in real-time based on user inpu

# Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language used for the project.

TensorFlow & Keras: Libraries used for building and training the neural network.

NumPy: For numerical operations.

Matplotlib: For data visualization.

Google Colab: An online platform for running the Jupyter notebooks.
